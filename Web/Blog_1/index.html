            Toshiro, a Longhart College student, with formidable forbidden magic, is to be executed 
            immediately after capture, as forbidden magic is, as it's name suggest, forbidden in the 
            Eventide Realm.
        </p>

            About to give himself in, rumours about his sister being guillotined got to him. His fury 
            got to his head, which lead to his huge tantrum, accidentally causing buildings worth millions 
            of coins crumbling to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being able to retrieve his sister, they accidentally enter another domain known as Japan, 
            city of the forbidden.

            Fortunately or not, they meet Mayu, a young chemist who takes them into her home, a place they never 
            should have set their foots in.

            Will our brave Toshiro meet his demise at the hands of the parliament, or suffer something far 
            greater than death?

                When people tell you what you&#39;re trying to create is impossible to do,
